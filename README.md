# Crime-in-India

"ðŸš€ Just wrapped up an extensive data analysis project on crime in India from 2001 to 2010! This repository contains all the code, datasets, and visualizations used to uncover trends in victim demographics across various states and union territories.

Highlights:
Geographic Insights: Analyzed crime data across regions like Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh, revealing key regional differences.
Demographic Breakdown: Focused on victim distribution across age groups, with significant findings such as the high number of victims aged 18-30 in states like Uttar Pradesh (699 out of 1,411 total victims in 2010).
Age-Based Patterns: Identified patterns in crime victimization, showing how different age groups, particularly 30-50 years, consistently represented a significant portion of victims.
This project showcases my skills in data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization. Check out the repo for a deep dive into the data and the tools used to bring these insights to life.

Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute!
